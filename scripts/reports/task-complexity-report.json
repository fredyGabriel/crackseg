      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the ConvLSTM component and CNN-ConvLSTM U-Net architecture into detailed subtasks, including: (1) ConvLSTM cell implementation, (2) ConvLSTM layer implementation, (3) CNN encoder development, (4) ConvLSTM bottleneck creation, (5) CNN decoder with skip connections, (6) full architecture assembly, (7) configuration setup, and (8) comprehensive testing. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details, dependencies, and testing strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing a complex deep learning architecture combining CNN and ConvLSTM components in a U-Net structure. It requires understanding of both spatial (CNN) and spatiotemporal (ConvLSTM) neural networks, along with the U-Net architecture's skip connections. The implementation spans multiple components (ConvLSTM cell, layer, encoder, bottleneck, decoder), configuration files, and comprehensive testing. The existing 8 subtasks appropriately cover all aspects of the implementation."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Swin Transformer V2 encoder component into detailed subtasks, including: (1) core implementation of the Swin V2 encoder class, (2) forward pass and feature extraction logic, (3) configuration integration with Hydra, (4) comprehensive unit testing, and (5) integration testing with other components. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details, dependencies, and testing approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing a state-of-the-art transformer architecture (Swin V2) as an encoder component. While complex, it's more focused than task #16 as it deals with a single component rather than a full architecture. The implementation requires understanding of transformer architectures, window-based self-attention, and integration with the existing EncoderBase interface. The current 5 subtasks appropriately cover implementation, configuration, and testing aspects."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the ASPP module into detailed subtasks, including: (1) basic class structure inheriting from BottleneckBase, (2) implementation of parallel atrous convolution branches, (3) completion of the forward method with branch fusion, (4) Hydra configuration integration, and (5) integration testing and performance optimization. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details, dependencies, and testing approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing the ASPP module, which is moderately complex but more focused than the previous tasks. It requires understanding of dilated convolutions, parallel branch architecture, and proper fusion of features. The implementation needs to follow the BottleneckBase interface and integrate with Hydra configuration. The 5 existing subtasks cover the implementation logically from basic structure to optimization."

For each subtask, provide specific implementation details, dependencies, and testing strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing an attention mechanism (CBAM) that combines channel and spatial attention. It's moderately complex but more focused than the previous tasks. The implementation requires understanding of attention mechanisms and integration with existing model architectures. The 5 existing subtasks logically divide the work from individual components to integration and configuration."

For each subtask, provide specific implementation details, dependencies, and testing approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex hybrid architecture combining multiple advanced components (SwinV2, CNN, ASPP, CBAM) into a cohesive U-Net model. It has high complexity due to the need to ensure proper integration between different component types, handle skip connections correctly, and manage feature dimensions throughout the network. The task depends on three previous tasks (#17, #18, #19) and requires careful integration of these components. The 5 existing subtasks appropriately divide the work."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the update of the model factory and registry into detailed subtasks, including: (1) registry module enhancement for new component types, (2) hybrid architecture registration support, (3) configuration parsing updates, (4) component instantiation implementation, and (5) code refactoring and optimization. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details, dependencies, and testing strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves consolidating and refactoring the model factory and registry to support all the newly implemented components and architectures. It requires a deep understanding of the existing factory pattern, component registration system, and configuration handling. The complexity comes from ensuring backward compatibility while adding support for new hybrid architectures and ensuring proper error handling. The 5 existing subtasks logically divide the work from registry updates to final optimization."
