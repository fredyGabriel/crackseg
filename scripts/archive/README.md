# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files that are no longer actively used but are kept for historical reference.

## Purpose

- Store completed plans and temporary documentation
- Maintain project history without cluttering the main scripts directory
- Provide reference for past decisions and implementations

## Contents

Currently empty - ready for future archiving needs.

## Guidelines

- Only move files here that are no longer actively used
- Keep original file names for easy identification
- Update this README when adding new files
- Consider cleanup of very old files periodically
