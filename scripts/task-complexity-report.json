      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the test suite evaluation task into subtasks covering: 1) Test inventory and execution, 2) Test categorization and documentation, 3) Code coverage measurement and analysis, and 4) Gap identification and reporting.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical activities requiring analysis of existing code and tests. The cyclomatic complexity is moderate as it involves decision points about test categorization. The task has clear steps but requires comprehensive understanding of the codebase and testing infrastructure."

      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for developing U-Net Decoder tests: 1) DecoderBlock channel calculation tests, 2) DecoderBlock input/skip handling tests, 3) DecoderBlock edge case tests, 4) CNNDecoder channel propagation tests, and 5) CNNDecoder initialization and end-to-end tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to the technical depth required to understand the decoder components and their expected behavior. It involves creating multiple test scenarios for different components and configurations, requiring detailed knowledge of the U-Net architecture."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the U-Net Decoder refactoring into: 1) Root cause analysis of channel mismatches, 2) DecoderBlock channel calculation redesign, 3) CNNDecoder channel propagation fixes, 4) Removal of convolutional adapters, 5) Test verification, and 6) Documentation updates.",
      "reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task involving deep understanding of the U-Net architecture and careful refactoring of core components. The cyclomatic complexity is high due to multiple decision points in the refactoring process and the need to ensure backward compatibility."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the U-Net integration testing into: 1) End-to-end pipeline tests, 2) Configuration variation tests, 3) Dimension and shape verification tests, 4) Compatibility tests with existing configurations, and 5) Serialization/deserialization tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires comprehensive testing of the entire U-Net model with various configurations. The complexity comes from the need to verify multiple aspects of the model's behavior and ensure no regressions were introduced during refactoring."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the loss function system implementation into: 1) Registry design and implementation, 2) Factory function development, 3) Existing loss function refactoring, 4) Nested loss combination support, 5) Configuration-based instantiation, and 6) Documentation and examples.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing a complex system with recursive construction logic. The Halstead complexity is high due to the number of operators and operands needed for the registry pattern and factory system implementation."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the training artifacts standardization into: 1) Artifact inventory and review, 2) Metrics logging implementation and verification, 3) Checkpoint management system improvements, and 4) Documentation and standardization of artifact formats.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves reviewing and standardizing existing systems rather than building new ones. The complexity comes from the need to understand multiple components of the training pipeline and ensure they work together correctly."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the test coverage expansion into: 1) Coverage analysis and prioritization, 2) Data module tests, 3) Training module tests, 4) Evaluation module tests, and 5) Utilities module tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires understanding multiple modules and developing appropriate tests for each. The complexity comes from the breadth of the codebase that needs to be covered and the variety of testing approaches needed."
