description: Guidelines for creating and maintaining Cursor rules to ensure consistency and effectiveness.
globs: .cursor/rules/*.mdc
alwaysApply: true
---
- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules

description: Enforce that all Git commit messages must be written in English
globs: ../../*.*, ../../**/*
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Commit messages must always be written in clear, correct English**
  - This applies to all commits, including documentation, code, configuration, and rule updates.
  - The subject and body of the commit message must be in English, regardless of the language used in code comments or documentation.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "fix(model): Correct off-by-one error in encoder output\n\n- Adjusted index calculation in forward method\n- Added test for edge case"
    ```
  - ❌ DON'T:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "arreglo bug en el encoder"
    ```
  - If a non-English message is required for legal or compliance reasons, add an English translation in the body.
  - This rule ensures consistency and accessibility for all contributors and reviewers.
