# Project Archive - CrackSeg

This directory contains archived files and documentation from the CrackSeg project development process.

## Purpose

The archive preserves:

- **Legacy documentation** that may contain valuable historical context
- **Outdated files** that were replaced but might be needed for reference
- **Development artifacts** from project evolution phases

## Structure

```txt
archive/
├── README.md           # This file - archive documentation
└── legacy_docs/        # Legacy documentation files
    ├── project-structure.mdc   # Archived project structure guide
    ├── structural-guide.mdc    # Archived structural patterns guide
    ├── development-guide.mdc   # Archived development workflow guide
    └── README.md              # Legacy documentation index
```

## Contents

### legacy_docs/

Contains documentation files that were part of earlier project phases:

- **`project-structure.mdc`** - Early project structure definition
- **`structural-guide.mdc`** - Architectural patterns and guidelines
- **`development-guide.mdc`** - Development workflow documentation

These files were archived because:

1. They may contain outdated information
2. Current documentation has superseded them
3. They were marked for removal during code cleanup
4. They may still contain valuable reference material

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Access Archive

- **Historical research**: Understanding project evolution
- **Pattern recovery**: Retrieving useful patterns that were removed
- **Documentation archaeology**: Finding context for current decisions
- **Backup recovery**: Restoring accidentally removed content

### When NOT to Use Archive

- **Current development**: Use active documentation instead
- **New team members**: Start with current guides
- **Implementation reference**: Use current code patterns

## Restoration Process

If you need to restore archived content:

1. **Review current documentation** first to avoid conflicts
2. **Identify specific needed sections** rather than whole files
3. **Update content** to match current project state
4. **Integrate gradually** with proper testing
5. **Document restoration** reasons and changes

## Archive Maintenance

- **Regular review**: Periodically assess archive relevance
- **Cleanup policy**: Remove truly obsolete content annually
- **Migration notes**: Document why items were archived
- **Access tracking**: Monitor what gets retrieved for future decisions
