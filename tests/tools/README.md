# Testing Tools

This directory contains specialized tools for testing, quality validation, and test execution management.

## Structure

- **quality/**: Test quality validation tools
  - `validate_test_quality.py`: Validates test file quality and standards
- **execution/**: Test execution and orchestration tools
  - `run_tests_phased.py`: Phased test execution with dependency management
  - `simple_install_check.sh`: Basic installation verification
- **coverage/**: Test coverage analysis tools
  - `check_test_files.py`: Verifies test file coverage for source files
  - `coverage_check.sh`: Coverage analysis with HTML reports
- **benchmark/**: Test performance benchmarking tools
  - `benchmark_tests.py`: Performance benchmarking for test execution

## Usage

### Test Quality Validation

```bash
python tests/tools/quality/validate_test_quality.py tests/unit/model/
```

### Phased Test Execution

```bash
python tests/tools/execution/run_tests_phased.py
```

### Coverage Analysis

```bash
python tests/tools/coverage/check_test_files.py src/model/
bash tests/tools/coverage/coverage_check.sh
```

### Test Performance Benchmarking

```bash
python tests/tools/benchmark/benchmark_tests.py tests/unit/
```

## Features

- **Quality validation**: Ensures tests meet project standards
- **Phased execution**: Manages test dependencies and execution order
- **Coverage tracking**: Monitors test coverage for source files
- **Performance optimization**: Benchmarks test execution performance
- **Installation verification**: Validates development environment setup

## Best Practices

1. Run quality validation before committing new tests
2. Use phased execution for complex test suites
3. Monitor coverage to ensure comprehensive testing
4. Benchmark tests regularly to maintain performance
5. Verify installation before running test suites

## Integration

These tools integrate with:

- `pytest`: Test execution framework
- `coverage.py`: Coverage analysis
- `tests/conftest.py`: Shared test fixtures
- `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`: Test directories
