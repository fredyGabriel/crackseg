# Data config that conflicts with model
data:
  batch_size: 4
  num_workers: 2
  channels: 1             # Conflicts with model input_channels: 3
  image_size: [512, 512]  # May conflict with model expectations

# Training config with impossible requirements
training:
  epochs: 100
  device: "cuda"          # May not be available
  require_cuda: true      # Forces CUDA requirement
  learning_rate: 999.0    # Extremely high learning rate
  batch_size: 1000000     # Impossibly large batch size

# Conflicting verification requirements
verification:
  require_gpu_memory: "32GB"    # More than most systems have
  expected_duration_minutes: 0.1  # Impossibly fast
  min_accuracy: 99.99     # Unrealistic accuracy target
