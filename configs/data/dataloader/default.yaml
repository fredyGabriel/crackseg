# DataLoader configuration for crack segmentation model
# NOTE: 'batch_size' and 'num_workers' are configured here for DataLoader parameters.

# Basic parameters
batch_size: 4              # Number of samples per batch - REDUCED for verification
num_workers: 2             # Number of worker processes for data loading - REDUCED for stability
shuffle: true            # Shuffle data at every epoch
pin_memory: true         # Pin memory for faster GPU transfer
prefetch_factor: 2       # Number of batches to prefetch per worker
drop_last: false         # Drop last incomplete batch (if True)

# Distributed training parameters
distributed:
  enabled: false         # Enable distributed training
  rank: 0                # Rank of the current process
  world_size: 1          # Total number of processes

# Sampler configuration
sampler:
  enabled: false         # Enable custom sampler
  kind: "random"         # Sampler type: "random", "balanced", "subset", "distributed"
  shuffle: true          # Shuffle data in sampler
  seed: 42               # Random seed for reproducibility
  # Additional parameters depending on sampler type:
  # labels: null         # For balanced sampler
  # indices: null        # For subset sampler
  # num_samples: null    # Number of samples to draw (optional)
  # replacement: false   # Allow sampling with replacement
  # drop_last: false     # Drop last incomplete batch

# Memory optimization
memory:
  fp16: false                # Use mixed precision (float16)
  adaptive_batch_size: false # Adjust batch size based on available memory
  max_memory_mb: null        # Memory limit in MB (null = use all available)

# Sample limits for quick tests - DISABLED FOR FULL DATASET TRAINING
# - To limit the number of samples (e.g., for quick tests), set a positive integer.
# - To use the full dataset, set to null, 0, or remove these lines.
# max_train_samples: 16        # Limit number of training samples (quick verification)
# max_val_samples: 8           # Limit number of validation samples
# max_test_samples: 8          # Limit number of test samples
