# Tutorial 02: High Learning Rate Experiment Configuration
#
# This configuration tests aggressive learning for faster convergence.
# Learning rate is 10x higher than default to see if we can achieve
# faster training while maintaining reasonable performance.
#
# Reference: docs/tutorials/02_custom_experiment_cli.md

# Hydra configuration composition - inherits from basic_verification config
defaults:
  - basic_verification  # Basic verification configuration with default settings
  - _self_              # This file overrides basic_verification settings

# Training hyperparameters override
training:
  learning_rate: 0.001  # High learning rate (10x default 0.0001) for fast convergence
  epochs: 50            # Reduced epochs since high LR should converge faster

# Data loading configuration override
data:
  dataloader:
    batch_size: 8       # Smaller batch size to accommodate higher learning rate
                        # Prevents gradient explosion with aggressive learning
