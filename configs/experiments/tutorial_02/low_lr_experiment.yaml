# Tutorial 02: Low Learning Rate Experiment Configuration
#
# This configuration tests conservative learning for maximum stability.
# Learning rate is 10x lower than default to see if we can achieve
# better final performance through slow, stable convergence.
#
# Reference: docs/tutorials/02_custom_experiment_cli.md

# Hydra configuration composition - inherits from basic_verification config
defaults:
  - basic_verification  # Basic verification configuration with default settings
  - _self_              # This file overrides basic_verification settings

# Training hyperparameters override
training:
  learning_rate: 0.00001  # Very low learning rate (1/10th of default 0.0001)
                          # for stable, conservative learning
  epochs: 100             # More epochs needed for slow convergence

# Data loading configuration override
data:
  dataloader:
    batch_size: 16        # Larger batch size since low LR is more stable
                          # Allows for better gradient estimates
