# Tutorial 02: Focal Loss Experiment Configuration
#
# This configuration tests Focal Loss for handling class imbalance in crack segmentation.
# Focal Loss down-weights easy examples and focuses on hard-to-classify pixels,
# which is crucial for crack detection where positive pixels are <5% of the image.
#
# Reference: docs/tutorials/02_custom_experiment_cli.md

# Hydra configuration composition - inherits from basic_verification config
defaults:
  - basic_verification  # Basic verification configuration with default settings
  - _self_              # This file overrides basic_verification settings

# Training hyperparameters override
training:
  loss:
    _target_: crackseg.training.losses.focal.FocalLoss  # Focal Loss implementation
    alpha: 0.25    # Weight for positive class (cracks) - balances class imbalance
    gamma: 2.0     # Focusing parameter - down-weights easy examples
  learning_rate: 0.0001  # Default learning rate for focal loss
  epochs: 75             # Moderate epochs for focal loss convergence

# Data loading configuration override
data:
  dataloader:
    batch_size: 12       # Moderate batch size for focal loss training
                         # Balances memory usage and gradient stability
