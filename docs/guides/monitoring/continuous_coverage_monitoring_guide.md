alert_config = AlertConfig(
    enabled=True,
    email_recipients=["team@company.com"],
    slack_webhook="https://hooks.slack.com/services/...",
    threshold_warning=75.0,      # Warning below 75%
    threshold_critical=70.0,     # Critical below 70%
    trend_alert_days=7,          # Check 7-day trends
    trend_decline_threshold=5.0  # Alert on 5% decline
)
```

#### Coverage Thresholds

Customize coverage targets in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.coverage.report]
fail_under = 80.0
show_missing = true
skip_covered = false

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = [
    "--cov-fail-under=80"
]
```

## Usage Guide

#### Analysis Capabilities

```bash
# Generate 30-day trend analysis
python scripts/monitoring/continuous_coverage.py --mode monitoring --days-history 30
```

**Example Trend Analysis Output**:

```json
{
  "period_days": 30,
  "data_points": 45,
  "coverage_trend": {
    "start": 78.5,
    "end": 82.1,
    "change": 3.6,
    "max": 84.2,
    "min": 76.8,
    "average": 80.7
  },
  "modules_trend": {
    "start": 110,
    "end": 118,
    "change": 8
  },
  "critical_gaps_trend": {
    "start": 18,
    "end": 12,
    "change": -6
  }
}
```

#### Database Schema

SQLite database stores historical coverage data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE coverage_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
    overall_coverage REAL NOT NULL,
    total_statements INTEGER NOT NULL,
    covered_statements INTEGER NOT NULL,
    missing_statements INTEGER NOT NULL,
    modules_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    modules_above_threshold INTEGER NOT NULL,
    critical_gaps INTEGER NOT NULL,
    branch_coverage REAL,
    test_count INTEGER,
    execution_time REAL,
    commit_hash TEXT,
    branch_name TEXT
);
```

### Using Historical Data

#### Query Recent Trends

```python
from crackseg.utils.monitoring.coverage_monitor import CoverageMonitor


monitor = CoverageMonitor()
trend_data = monitor.analyze_trends(days=30)

print(f"Coverage change over 30 days: {trend_data['coverage_trend']['change']:.1f}%")
```

#### Export Historical Data

```bash
# Export database to CSV for external analysis
sqlite3 outputs/coverage_monitoring/coverage_history.db \
  "SELECT * FROM coverage_history" \
  -header -csv > coverage_history.csv
```

#### Monthly Reporting

The system automatically generates monthly summaries stored in `.github/data/coverage/`:

- **summary_YYYY-MM.json**: Monthly coverage summary
- **coverage_history.db**: Complete historical database

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Coverage Analysis Fails

**Symptoms**: Script exits with error, no coverage data generated

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Run with verbose logging
python scripts/monitoring/continuous_coverage.py --mode analysis --verbose

# Check pytest execution
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing -v
```

**Solutions**:

- Check test discovery: `pytest --collect-only`
- Validate coverage configuration in `pyproject.toml`

#### 2. Historical Database Issues

**Symptoms**: Trend analysis fails, database corruption errors

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Check database integrity
sqlite3 outputs/coverage_monitoring/coverage_history.db "PRAGMA integrity_check"

# Verify table structure
sqlite3 outputs/coverage_monitoring/coverage_history.db ".schema coverage_history"
```

**Solutions**:

- Backup and recreate database:
  `rm coverage_history.db && python scripts/monitoring/continuous_coverage.py --mode analysis`
- Check file permissions on database directory
- Verify SQLite installation

#### 3. Alert System Not Working

**Symptoms**: No alerts sent despite coverage drops

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Test alert system
python scripts/monitoring/continuous_coverage.py --mode alerts --verbose

# Check alert configuration
python -c "from crackseg.utils.monitoring.coverage_monitor import AlertConfig; print(AlertConfig())"
```

**Solutions**:

- Verify alert configuration parameters
- Test email/Slack credentials separately
- Check network connectivity for external services

#### 4. CI/CD Integration Issues

**Symptoms**: Workflow fails, missing artifacts

**Diagnosis**:

- Check workflow permissions and access

### Debug Mode

Enable comprehensive debugging:

```bash
# Maximum verbosity
python scripts/monitoring/continuous_coverage.py \
  --mode analysis \
  --verbose \
  --output-dir debug_output

# Check generated files
ls -la debug_output/
```

### Log Analysis

Monitor log files for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Real-time log monitoring
tail -f outputs/coverage_monitoring/monitoring.log

# Search for specific errors
grep -i "error\|exception\|failed" outputs/coverage_monitoring/monitoring.log
```
