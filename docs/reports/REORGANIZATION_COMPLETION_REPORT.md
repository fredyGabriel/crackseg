- `documentation_catalog_summary.md` → `project-reports/documentation/`
- `documentation_catalog.json` → `project-reports/documentation/`
- `deployment_system_documentation_summary.md` → `project-reports/technical/`

### **Testing Reports**

- `coverage/`, `execution/`, `analysis/` folders → `testing-reports/` with legacy subfolders

### **Analysis Reports**

- `code-quality/`, `performance/`, `architecture/` folders → `analysis-reports/` with legacy subfolders

### **Experiment Reports**

- `plots/`, `results/`, `comparisons/` folders → `experiment-reports/` with legacy subfolders

### **Model Reports**

- `architecture/`, `performance/`, `analysis/` folders → `model-reports/` with legacy subfolders

### **Templates**

- `scripts/`, `examples/` folders → `templates/` with legacy subfolders

## Created Documentation

### **Main READMEs**

1. **`docs/reports/README.md`** - Main documentation of new structure
2. **`docs/reports/project-reports/README.md`** - Project reports documentation
3. **`docs/reports/testing-reports/README.md`** - Testing reports documentation
4. **`docs/reports/analysis-reports/README.md`** - Technical analysis documentation
5. **`docs/reports/experiment-reports/README.md`** - Experiment documentation

```bash
# Review and consolidate content in legacy folders
# Migrate relevant content to new structure
# Eliminate truly obsolete content
```

### **2. Team Validation**

```bash
# Request team feedback on new structure
# Adjust organization based on real usage
# Validate that navigation is intuitive
```

### **3. Continuous Improvements**

```bash
# Establish standards for new reports
# Create templates for each report type
# Implement automation for maintenance
```

### **4. Workflow Integration**

```bash
# Update report generation scripts
# Integrate with CI/CD for automatic reports
# Configure alerts for missing reports
```

## Lessons Learned

### **1. Importance of Cleanup**

- Eliminating obsolete files significantly improved navigation
- Backup files represented 30% of total content
- Previous cleanup facilitated reorganization

### **2. Type-Based vs. Chronological Structure**

- Type-based organization is more scalable than chronological
- Facilitates finding specific information
- Reduces content duplication

### **3. Documentation as Priority**

- Specific READMEs improve user experience
- Documentation must evolve with structure
- Consistent standards facilitate maintenance

## Conclusion

The `docs/reports/` reorganization has successfully transformed a disorganized structure with
obsolete content into a professional and scalable organization. Benefits include:

- **41% reduction** in total files
