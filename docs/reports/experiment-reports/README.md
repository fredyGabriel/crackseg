# Experiment Reports - CrackSeg Documentation

> **Experiment reports for the CrackSeg project**
>
> This section contains visualizations, results and experiment comparisons for the crack
> segmentation system.

## 🔬 Purpose

**Experiment Reports** are designed for teams that need to:

- **Visualize** experiment results
- **Compare** different configurations
- **Analyze** performance metrics
- **Document** conducted experiments

## 📁 Structure

```bash
experiment-reports/
├── plots/               # Graphs and visualizations
│   └── legacy/         # Legacy graphs
├── results/             # Experiment results
└── comparisons/         # Experiment comparisons
```

## 📊 Available Reports

### **Plots**

- Training curve graphs
- Performance visualizations
- Comparison graphs
- Visual result analysis

### **Results**

- Detailed experiment results
- Performance metrics
- Used configurations
- Result analysis

### **Comparisons**

- Model comparisons
- Different configuration analysis
- Performance benchmarks
- Improvement evaluation

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Visualizations**: Check `plots/` for graphs
2. **Results**: Go to `results/` for data
3. **Comparisons**: Check `comparisons/`

## 🔄 Migration

The `legacy/` folders contain previous documentation that is being progressively migrated to the
new structure. This documentation will be consolidated and updated progressively.
