# Deletion plan and impact assessment

This plan consolidates findings from recent audits to propose safe removals or consolidations. All actions follow c1â€“c4 and will be executed in small PRs with clear rollback.

- Inventory: docs/reports/file_inventory.md
- Artifacts/binaries: docs/reports/project-reports/technical/artifacts_and_binaries_audit.md
- Language: docs/reports/project-reports/documentation/language_compliance_report.md

## Summary of proposed actions

- Duplicates: deduplicate assets (logos, legacy plots) and redundant init files
- Unused modules: validate high-probability unused under `evaluation/visualization/legacy/`, `reporting/`, and deployment helpers
- Artifacts: ensure `.gitignore` coverage; no >50 MB files detected
- Language: translate/merge legacy Spanish docs; archive strictly Spanish variants

## Detailed proposals

### A. Potential duplicate groups (size+hash)

Decision model: keep canonical, remove duplicates; update references; add CI check.

- Group 1
  - `docs/designs/logo.png`
  - `gui/assets/images/logos/primary-logo.png`
  - Action: keep `gui/assets/images/logos/primary-logo.png`; remove `docs/designs/logo.png`; update docs to reference canonical asset
  - Risk: low; Rollback: restore deleted file if referenced in older docs

- Group 2
  - `docs/reports/experiment-reports/plots/legacy/training_curves_20250724_081112.png`
  - `docs/reports/experiment-reports/plots/legacy/training_curves_20250724_081136.png`
  - Action: deduplicate by content; keep one with clearer naming and update links
  - Risk: low; Rollback: keep both if provenance matters

- Group 3
  - `tests/unit/__init__.py`
  - `tests/unit/gui/__init__.py`
  - Review only (defer deletion): `gui/__init__.py`, `gui/services/__init__.py`
  - Action: remove unnecessary test `__init__.py` after verifying test discovery; defer GUI package files to separate ticket
  - Risk: medium (import paths); Rollback: restore removed `__init__.py`

- Group 4
  - `scripts/__init__.py`
  - `tests/__init__.py`
  - Action: treat similarly to Group 3; remove unnecessary `__init__.py` if not needed for namespace
  - Risk: medium; Rollback: restore file if discovery/imports break

### B. Unused Python modules under `src/` (n=89)

Decision model: confirm unused via grep/tests; delete or integrate. Prioritize legacy visualization/reporting and deployment helpers.

- High-probability unused categories (examples)
  - `src/crackseg/evaluation/visualization/legacy/*`
  - `src/crackseg/reporting/*` and `src/crackseg/utils/deployment/*` subsets
  - Actions: create per-module tickets; run quick import/usage checks; remove if truly dead; otherwise move to `docs/legacy-snippets/` or mark deprecated
  - Risk: medium (hidden imports in configs/tests); Rollback: revert deletion; add deprecation period

### C. Backup and generated files

- Remove `src/crackseg/training/trainer.py.backup` (not referenced by imports/tests)
- Risk: low; Rollback: restore if needed

### C. Artifacts and binaries

- Status: no files >50 MB detected; artifacts largely covered by `.gitignore`
- Action: `.gitignore` already updated with missing entries; re-run audit in CI weekly
- Risk: low; Rollback: n/a

### D. Language compliance

- Actions
  - Translate or consolidate Spanish docs flagged in `language_compliance_report.md`
  - Archive Spanish-only legacy docs under `docs/legacy/` if not needed
  - Ensure README/active guides are English-only
- Risk: low; Rollback: keep originals in `docs/legacy/`

## Impact and verification

- Affected areas: docs links, GUI assets, package discovery (`__init__.py`), optional visualization/reporting modules
- Verification
  - Run full quality gates and smoke tests
  - Import graph check for removed `__init__.py`
  - Broken-link checker across docs
  - Grep for removed paths before merge

## Rollback strategy

- Each change in separate PR with clear scope
- Tag PRs with `cleanup` and link to this plan
- If issues arise, revert PR entirely (single-commit PRs preferred)

## Next steps (tickets)

1. Dedupe logos (Group 1)
2. Dedupe legacy plots (Group 2)
3. Prune unnecessary test `__init__.py` (Group 3)
4. Remove `trainer.py.backup`
5. Validate y remover top-20 unused modules (batch 1)
6. Translate/consolidate top-10 Spanish docs
7. Add CI checks: duplicate guard and link checker (done for links)
