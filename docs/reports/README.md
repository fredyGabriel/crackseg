2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):** Configuration systems → 80% coverage
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):** Training infrastructure → 83% coverage
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8):** Specialized components → 85% coverage

### 🏆 Major Achievements

- **67 unit tests** implemented for critical modules
- **11 integration tests** for key workflows
- **Testing patterns** documented and standardized
- **100% compliance** with quality standards (basedpyright, ruff, black)

## 🧹 Recent Reorganization (January 2025)

### Improved File Organization

The reports directory has been reorganized for better navigation and logical grouping:

- **Project Documentation**: Core technical papers and project overview moved to `project/`
- **Technical Analysis**: Code quality and refactoring reports moved to `analysis/`
- **Testing Reports**: All testing-related documentation consolidated in `testing/`
- **Task Progress**: Task completion reports organized in `tasks/`
- **Coverage Analysis**: Code coverage reports remain in `coverage/`

### Benefits Achieved

- **Better Navigation**: Logical grouping by content type
- **Reduced Clutter**: Root directory now contains only essential files
- **Improved Discovery**: Related reports grouped together
- **Maintained Structure**: Existing subdirectories preserved and enhanced
