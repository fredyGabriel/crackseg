## 🎯 New Structure by Report Type

The documentation has been reorganized following modern ML project best practices, organized by
report type:

### 📋 **Project Reports** (`project-reports/`)

**Main project reports** and technical documentation.

- **Technical**: Technical architecture reports
- **Documentation**: Project documentation and structure
- **Academic**: Academic papers and scientific reports

### 🧪 **Testing Reports** (`testing-reports/`)

**Testing reports** and quality analysis.

- **Coverage**: Code coverage analysis
- **Execution**: Test execution reports
- **Analysis**: Testing strategy analysis

### 📊 **Analysis Reports** (`analysis-reports/`)

**Technical analysis** of quality and performance.

- **Code Quality**: Code quality analysis
- **Performance**: System performance analysis
- **Architecture**: Architecture analysis

### 🔬 **Experiment Reports** (`experiment-reports/`)

**Experiment reports** and visualizations.

- **Plots**: Graphs and visualizations
- **Results**: Experiment results
- **Comparisons**: Experiment comparisons

### 🏗️ **Model Reports** (`model-reports/`)

**Model reports** and architectures.

- **Architecture**: Model architecture analysis
- **Performance**: Model performance analysis
- **Analysis**: Detailed model analysis

### 📜 **Templates** (`templates/`)

**Templates and examples** for development.

- **Scripts**: Example scripts and utilities
- **Examples**: Example files and references

## 📖 How to Navigate

- Reduced learning curve

### **4. Documentation Quality**

- Elimination of obsolete files (41% reduction)
- Consolidated duplicate content
- Consistent standards by type

## 📝 Contributing

When adding new reports:

1. **Identify the type**: Is it project, testing, analysis, experiment, model or template?
2. **Place in appropriate section**: Use the type-based structure
3. **Update README**: Keep documentation updated
4. **Follow conventions**: Use established format

## 📊 Reorganization Metrics

- **Total files**: 51 (reduced from 87)
- **Obsolete files eliminated**: 36
- **Content reduction**: 41%
- **New sections**: 6 main types
- **Subsections**: 18 specific categories
