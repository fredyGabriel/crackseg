   - Command-line interfaces and main execution paths
   - Requires integration testing with actual training workflows

2. **Specialized Model Components** (0-37% coverage)
   - Advanced attention mechanisms and registry systems
   - Complex architectural components requiring domain expertise

3. **Training Infrastructure** (18-40% coverage)
   - Complete training loops and checkpoint management
   - Distributed training and advanced optimization features

### Medium Priority Gaps

1. **Configuration Instantiation** (12-19% coverage)
   - Complex configuration parsing and validation
   - Dynamic component instantiation systems

2. **Visualization and Logging** (15-50% coverage)
   - Plotting and visualization utilities
   - Advanced logging and experiment tracking

## Quality Assurance Results

### Linting and Type Checking

- **basedpyright:** 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **ruff:** Clean (all issues resolved)
- **black:** Properly formatted

### Test Execution Health

- **Success Rate:** 86.4% (748/866 tests passing)
- **Failed Tests:** 97 (primarily in specialized components and integration scenarios)
- **Error Categories:**
  - Configuration and path issues (Windows-specific)
  - Complex model component interactions
  - Missing test data and fixtures

## Recommendations for Continued Improvement

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)

1. **Address Failed Tests:** Focus on the 97 failing tests to reach >95% success rate
2. **Main Entry Point Coverage:** Implement integration tests for `src/main.py` and `src/evaluate.py`
3. **Configuration Testing:** Expand coverage for instantiation and validation systems

### Medium-Term Goals (Next 2-3 Sprints)

1. **Specialized Components:** Develop tests for attention mechanisms and registry systems
2. **Training Infrastructure:** Complete trainer and checkpoint management coverage
3. **End-to-End Testing:** Implement full pipeline integration tests

### Long-Term Objectives

1. **Target 85% Overall Coverage:** Systematic coverage of remaining gaps
2. **Performance Testing:** Add performance regression tests for critical paths
3. **Documentation Testing:** Ensure all public APIs have corresponding test coverage

## Technical Achievements
