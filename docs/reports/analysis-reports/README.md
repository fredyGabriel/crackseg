## 📊 Purpose

**Analysis Reports** are designed for teams that need to:

- **Evaluate** code quality
- **Analyze** system performance
- **Review** project architecture
- **Identify** improvement areas

## 📁 Structure

```bash
analysis-reports/
├── code-quality/        # Code quality analysis
│   └── legacy/         # Legacy analysis
├── performance/         # Performance analysis
└── architecture/        # Architecture analysis
```

## 📊 Available Reports

### **Code Quality**

- Code quality analysis
- Linting and type checking reports
- Complexity analysis
- Improvement recommendations

### **Performance**

- System performance analysis
- Speed and memory metrics
- Implemented optimizations
- Component benchmarks

### **Architecture**

- System architecture analysis
- Used design patterns
