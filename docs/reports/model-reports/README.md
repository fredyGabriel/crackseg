# Model Reports - CrackSeg Documentation

> **Model reports for the CrackSeg project**
>
> This section contains architecture, performance and model analysis for the crack segmentation system.

## 🏗️ Purpose

**Model Reports** are designed for teams that need to:

- **Analyze** model architecture
- **Evaluate** model performance
- **Compare** different architectures
- **Document** modeling decisions

## 📁 Structure

```bash
model-reports/
├── architecture/        # Architecture analysis
│   └── legacy/         # Legacy analysis
├── performance/         # Performance analysis
└── analysis/            # Model analysis
```

## 📊 Available Reports

### **Architecture**

- Model architecture analysis
- Used design patterns
- Architectural decisions
- Architecture evolution

### **Performance**

- Model performance metrics
- Speed benchmarks
- Memory analysis
- Implemented optimizations

### **Analysis**

- Detailed model analysis
- Architecture comparisons
- Component evaluation
- Improvement recommendations

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Architecture**: Check `architecture/`
2. **Performance**: Go to `performance/`
3. **Analysis**: Check `analysis/`

## 🔄 Migration

The `legacy/` folders contain previous documentation that is being progressively migrated to the
new structure. This documentation will be consolidated and updated progressively.
