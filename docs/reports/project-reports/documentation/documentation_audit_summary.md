# Documentation Audit Summary (Phase 4)

Scope: docs/ and infrastructure/ documentation; README/CONTRIBUTING at repo root.

Outcomes (2025-08-10):
- Link Checker: 0 issues across `docs/` and `infrastructure/`.
- Project Tree: regenerated via `scripts/utils/documentation/generate_project_tree.py`.
- Dependency Graph: generated via `scripts/utils/analysis/generate_dependency_graph.py`.
- Legacy links: corrected across tutorials, infra docs, and legacy guides.
- New root docs: `CONTRIBUTING.md` added; `README.md` links to CONTRIBUTING/CHANGELOG.

Consolidation Focus:
- Centralize developer guides under `docs/guides/developer-guides/`, keep legacy variants under `legacy/` with pointers.
- Operational workflows under `docs/guides/operational-guides/` with `legacy/` subfolders linked explicitly.
- Technical specs under `docs/guides/technical-specs/specifications/legacy/` for historical docs.

Verification:
- Guardrails link checker green (0 issues).
- Regenerated reports committed alongside mapping updates.

Next Steps:
- Continue reducing duplication by merging overlapping legacy guides (see consolidation map).
- Keep link checker in CI guardrails to prevent regressions.
