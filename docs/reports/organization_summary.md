# Report Organization Summary

## Current Structure

Effective January 2025, the project reports are organized as follows:

```txt
docs/reports/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                           # Main index and navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ organization_summary.md             # This file - organization overview
â”œâ”€â”€ documentation_checklist.md          # Documentation standards checklist
â”œâ”€â”€
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“Š Core Report Categories/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ testing/                        # Testing reports and strategies
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ coverage/                       # Code coverage analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/                          # Task Master reports (reference copies)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/                         # Model architecture analysis

```

## Parallel Structures (Maintained Separately)

### Development Tools

```txt
scripts/reports/                        # Analysis tools and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ model_imports_autofix.py           # Auto-fix import paths
â”œâ”€â”€ model_imports_validation.py        # Validate import structure
â”œâ”€â”€ model_imports_catalog.py          # Generate import catalogs
â”œâ”€â”€ model_imports_cycles.py           # Detect import cycles
â”œâ”€â”€ model_pyfiles_inventory.py        # Python file inventory
â”œâ”€â”€ compare_model_structure.py        # Structure comparison
â””â”€â”€ autofix_backups/                  # Backup files from auto-fixes
```

### Task Master Integration

```txt
.taskmaster/                           # Task Master working directory (PRESERVED)
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/                          # Task Master generated reports
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ task-complexity-report.json  # Complexity analysis
â””â”€â”€ .taskmaster/                      # Internal Task Master structure
    â””â”€â”€ reports/                      # Internal reports
        â””â”€â”€ task-complexity-report.json
```

## Reorganization Changes (January 2025)

### âœ… Completed Actions

1. **Created `docs/reports/scripts/`**
   - New category for example files and templates
   - Separated documentation from development tools

2. **Moved Example Files**
   - `scripts/reports/example_prd.txt` â†’ `docs/reports/scripts/example_prd.txt`
   - `scripts/reports/hydra_examples.txt` â†’ `docs/reports/scripts/hydra_examples.txt`

3. **Preserved Task Master Compatibility**
   - Left `.taskmaster/` structure completely intact
   - Task Master can continue generating reports in original locations

4. **Maintained Tool Separation**
   - Analysis scripts remain in `scripts/reports/` as development tools
   - Documentation and examples moved to `docs/reports/scripts/`

### ðŸš« Explicitly NOT Done (By Design)

1. **Task Master Structure** - Preserved for compatibility
2. **Script Tools** - Kept in original location as they are utilities, not reports
3. **Duplicated Task Reports** - Left in place to avoid breaking Task Master

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation**: Tools vs Documentation vs Reports
2. **Centralized Documentation**: One place to find example files
3. **Preserved Compatibility**: Task Master continues working normally
4. **Logical Organization**: Similar content grouped together
5. **Reduced Confusion**: Clear distinction between outputs and tools

## Usage Guidelines

### For Documentation/Examples

- Use files in `docs/reports/scripts/` for templates and examples
- Reference `docs/reports/README.md` for navigation

### For Development/Analysis

- Use scripts in `scripts/reports/` for code analysis and maintenance
- These are tools, not documentation

### For Task Master

- Task Master continues using `.taskmaster/` as before
- Reference copies may exist in `docs/reports/tasks/` for documentation

## Future Considerations

1. **Archive Policy**: Old reports automatically move to `archive/` after 3 months
2. **Tool Updates**: Analysis scripts may evolve independently of documentation
3. **Task Master**: May generate new reports in `.taskmaster/reports/` as needed
4. **Analysis Expansion**: `docs/reports/analysis/` available for future analysis reports

*Organization implemented: January 2025*
*Compatibility with Task Master and development workflows preserved*
