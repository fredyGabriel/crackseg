# Report Organization Summary

**Date:** January 6, 2025
**Task:** Organization of scattered CrackSeg project reports

## 🎯 Objective

Consolidate and organize all project reports, analysis, and technical documentation that were scattered across multiple locations, creating a coherent, intuitive, and professional structure.

## 📊 Previous Situation (Scattered)

### Original Locations

- **`outputs/`**: 8 testing and coverage report files
- **`docs/reports/`**: 2 old statistical reports
- **`scripts/reports/`**: 7 model and task analysis files
- **Project root**: Temporary files and verification plan
- **`docs/testing/`**: Testing pattern documentation

### Identified Problems

- ❌ Reports scattered across 5+ different locations
- ❌ No clear organizational structure
- ❌ Difficult navigation and information search
- ❌ Mix of temporary reports with permanent documentation
- ❌ No centralized report index

## 🏗️ New Organizational Structure
