# Tutorial 2: Creating a Custom Experiment

**TODO: This tutorial needs verification and testing with the current GUI implementation.**

This tutorial explains how to use the GUI's advanced features to create,
modify, and save a custom configuration for your experiment. You can also use CLI commands.

## Prerequisites

- You have completed Tutorial 1 and understand the basic training workflow.
- **CRITICAL**: You have installed the `crackseg` package (`pip install -e . --no-deps`).
- You have verified the installation works (`python -c "import crackseg"`).

## Option A: Using the GUI (Recommended)

### Step 1: Load a Base Configuration

1. Launch the GUI (`conda activate crackseg && streamlit run gui/app.py`).
2. Navigate to the **Experiment Configuration** page.
3. Load the `configs/base.yaml` file using the file browser, just as you did
    in the previous tutorial.

### Step 2: Modify the Configuration in the Editor

1. Once `base.yaml` is loaded, scroll down to the
    **"Editor & Real-time Validation"** expander.
2. The content of the configuration is displayed in an advanced code editor.
3. Let's modify the learning rate. Find the `optimizer` section and change
    the `lr` value from `0.0001` to `0.0005`.

    ```yaml
    # ...
    optimizer:
      _target_: torch.optim.AdamW
      lr: 0.0001 # Change this to 0.0005
    # ...
    ```

4. Notice the **Real-time Validation** panel next to the editor. It provides
    instant feedback. If you introduce a syntax error (e.g., incorrect
    indentation), it will immediately flag it as a `YAML Error`. If you
    reference a component that doesn't exist, it will raise a
    `Hydra Instantiation Error`.

### Step 3: Save the Custom Configuration

1. After modifying the content, scroll to the "Save Changes" section below
    the editor.
2. Click the **"ðŸ’¾ Save Configuration As..."** button. A save dialog will
    appear.
3. In the dialog, provide a **File Name** for your new configuration, for
    example: `custom_lr_experiment`. The `.yaml` extension is added
    automatically.
4. The dialog shows where the file will be saved (typically in the
    `generated_configs/` directory).
5. Click **"Save"**. The file is saved, and the dialog closes. You should see a
    notification confirming the save.

### Step 4: Run the Custom Experiment

1. Your new configuration is **not** automatically loaded. You must now load
    the file you just created.
2. Go back to the **"Model Configuration"** section at the top of the page.
3. Use the file browser to navigate into the `generated_configs/` directory
    and select your `custom_lr_experiment.yaml` file.
4. Set a new, descriptive **Run Directory**, such as
    `outputs/custom_lr_run`.
5. Navigate to the **Train** page and start the training.
6. Monitor the experiment. How does the increased learning rate affect the
    training dynamics compared to your first run?

## Option B: Using CLI Commands

### Step 1: Create Custom Configuration File

Create a new configuration file manually:

```bash
conda activate crackseg
mkdir -p generated_configs
```

Create `generated_configs/custom_lr_experiment.yaml`:

```yaml
# generated_configs/custom_lr_experiment.yaml
defaults:
  - base
  - _self_

# Override learning rate
training:
  optimizer:
    lr: 0.0005  # Increased from 0.0001
```

### Step 2: Run the Custom Experiment

Execute the training with your custom configuration:

```bash
conda activate crackseg
python run.py --config-name custom_lr_experiment
```

### Step 3: Monitor and Compare

Monitor the training and compare with your baseline:

```bash
conda activate crackseg
# View training logs
tail -f artifacts/outputs/custom_lr_experiment/training.log

# Compare results
ls artifacts/outputs/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Configuration Not Found

    - Ensure the `generated_configs/` directory exists
    - Check file permissions and syntax

2. Import Errors

    - Verify package installation: `python -c "import crackseg"`
    - Reinstall if needed: `pip install -e . --no-deps`

3. GUI Issues

    - Use CLI commands as alternative
    - Check Streamlit installation: `pip install streamlit`

### Quality Gates

After creating custom configurations, verify code quality:

```bash
conda activate crackseg
black .
python -m ruff . --fix
basedpyright .
```

## What's Next?

You now know how to tailor experiments using both GUI and CLI. The next tutorial covers
the more advanced topic of extending the project with your own custom Python
components, like a new model architecture or loss function.
