## Project Overview

**Domain**: Deep learning-based pavement crack segmentation using PyTorch

**Goal**: Develop a production-ready, modular, and reproducible crack detection
system

**Architecture**: Encoder-decoder models with configurable components via Hydra

> **Important Note:** The main Task Master tasks file (`tasks.json`) is located
> at `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`. All tools, scripts, and workflows must
> refer to this location to access and modify project tasks.

## Rule Loading Instructions

**CRITICAL**: You MUST load relevant rules based on task context using
`fetch_rules`:

### Automatic Rule Loading Triggers

- **Coding Python files**: `fetch_rules(["coding-standards", "core-principles"])`
- **PyTorch/ML work**: `fetch_rules(["ml-pytorch-standards"])`
- **Writing/running tests**: `fetch_rules(["testing-standards"])`
- **Task management**: `fetch_rules(["taskmaster-guide"])`
- **Git operations**: `fetch_rules(["git-standards"])`
- **Project planning**: `fetch_rules(["development-workflow"])`
- **File organization**: `fetch_rules(["project-structure"])`

### When to Load Rules

- **Before** implementing any code changes
- **Before** suggesting architectural decisions
- **Before** creating tests or documentation
- **When** user asks about project standards or workflows

### Rule Loading Validation Checklist

After loading rules, verify your understanding of:

- [ ] **Quality Gates**: Can execute `black .`, `python -m ruff . --fix`,
  `basedpyright .` commands (environment should be pre-activated)
- [ ] **Terminal Efficiency**: DO NOT use unnecessary `echo` for feedback -
  communicate directly in chat response
- [ ] **Language Compliance**: ALL technical files MUST be in English only
- [ ] **Pre-Action Checklist**: Always verify compliance protocol before changes
- [ ] **Three-Option Analysis**: Document 3+ approaches for any decision
  requiring >2 hours of work
- [ ] **Evidence Requirements**: Reference specific files/lines
  (e.g., `src/model/encoder.py:45-52`)
- [ ] **Crack Detection Specifics**: Handle <5% positive pixels, detect
  1-5px width structures
- [ ] **Hardware Constraints**: Optimize for RTX 3070 Ti with 8GB VRAM limit
- [ ] **Testing Coverage**: Maintain >80% coverage on core functionality

## Core Development Principles

### 1. **AI Assistant Behavior**

- **Autonomous Expert**: Act as a senior ML engineer with minimal interruptions
- **Evidence-Based**: Support decisions with code references and documentation
- **Professional Analysis**: Always analyze 3+ options for significant decisions
- See [core-principles.mdc](/.cursor/rules/core-principles.mdc) for detailed
  guidelines

### 2. **Code Quality Standards**

- **Mandatory Quality Gates**: `conda activate crackseg && basedpyright`,
  `conda activate crackseg && black`, `conda activate crackseg && python -m ruff`
  must pass (**CRITICAL**: PowerShell requires explicit conda activation)
- **Type Safety**: Complete type annotations using Python 3.12+ features
- **Documentation**: English docstrings for all public APIs
- See [coding-standards.mdc](/.cursor/rules/coding-standards.mdc) for
  implementation details

### 3. **ML/PyTorch Standards**

- **Reproducibility**: Seed control, versioning, configuration storage
- **Model Architecture**: Modular encoder-decoder with factory patterns
- **Training Pipeline**: Checkpoint management, metric tracking, loss registry
- **Hardware Optimization**: RTX 3070 Ti considerations (8GB VRAM limit)
- See [ml-pytorch-standards.mdc](/.cursor/rules/ml-pytorch-standards.mdc) for
  specifics

### 4. **Project Workflow**

- **Task Management**: Use Task Master for planning and progress tracking
- **Development Process**: Plan → Implement → Test → Document → Review
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for components, integration for pipelines
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous verification at each step
- See [development-workflow.mdc](/.cursor/rules/development-workflow.mdc) for
  process

  slash, no URL encoding). The tasks file MUST ALWAYS be at
  `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`.

See [taskmaster.mdc](/.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc) for details.

> **MCP Workaround**: Due to a bug in Task Master MCP server v0.16.2, always
> include the full file path parameter in MCP calls:
> `file="C:/Users/youruser/project/.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json"`

## Domain-Specific Context

### Crack Segmentation Challenges

- **Class Imbalance**: Typically <5% positive pixels in crack images
- **Thin Structures**: Cracks are often 1-5 pixels wide requiring precise
  detection
- **Multi-Scale Features**: Crack patterns vary from hairline to large
  structural damage
- **Edge Preservation**: Boundary accuracy is critical for engineering
  applications

### Technical Constraints

- **Hardware**: RTX 3070 Ti with 8GB VRAM limitations
- **Framework**: PyTorch with Hydra configuration system
- **Quality Gates**: All code must pass `basedpyright`, `black`, `python -m ruff`
  (environment should be pre-activated)
- **Testing**: >80% coverage on core functionality

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Correctness First**: Ensure mathematical accuracy in loss functions and
   metrics
2. **Type Safety**: Leverage Python 3.12+ type system for reliability
3. **Modularity**: Design components for reusability and testing
4. **Performance**: Optimize only after correctness is verified
5. **Documentation**: Keep code self-documenting with clear naming and structure

## System Integration Guidelines

### Development Workflow Integration

- Always start with Task Master task review
- Load appropriate rules before implementation
- Follow three-option analysis for significant decisions
- Ensure all quality gates pass before completion
- Update documentation and task status continuously

### Rule Evolution Process

- Rules should evolve based on project experience
- Use [self_improve.mdc](/.cursor/rules/self_improve.mdc) for systematic updates
- Follow [rules_checklist.mdc](/.cursor/rules/rules_checklist.mdc) for quality
- Document rule changes in project history

## Troubleshooting

### Rule Loading Issues

#### Rule Not Found

- **Verify exact rule name** (case-sensitive): Rules use lowercase with hyphens
- **Check file exists**: Ensure file is present in `/.cursor/rules/`
- **Try manual loading first**: Test with single rule before multiple
- **Example**: `fetch_rules(["coding-standards"])` not
  `fetch_rules(["Coding-Standards"])`

#### Partial Rule Loading

- **Check for syntax errors** in rule files using markdown linters
- **Verify no circular dependencies** between rules
- **Ensure rule file size** is under 100KB for optimal loading
- **Test incrementally**: Load rules one by one to identify problematic file

#### Rules Not Applied

- **Confirm rule was loaded**: Check if content appears in context
- **Verify trigger conditions**: Ensure you're in the right context for auto-load
- **Check for conflicts**: Some rules may override others if loaded together
- **Reset and reload**: Clear context and reload rules if needed

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "No rules found" | Incorrect rule name or path | Verify exact filename without `.mdc` extension |
| "fetch_rules is not defined" | Tool not available | Ensure using AI assistant with MCP tools enabled |
| "Rule too large" | File exceeds size limit | Split rule into smaller focused files |
| "Invalid rule format" | Markdown syntax errors | Validate rule file with markdown linter |

### Quality Gates Environment Issues

#### Conda Environment Management

**Current Status:** The conda environment is maintained between terminal commands,
so explicit activation is not required for each command.

**✅ CORRECT PATTERN:**

```bash
# ✅ Direct commands work when environment is active
black archivo.py
python -m ruff check archivo.py --fix
basedpyright archivo.py

# ✅ Combined quality gates
python -m ruff check . && black . --check && basedpyright .
```

**🚫 AVOID unnecessary activation:**

```bash
# ❌ Unnecessary - environment is already active
conda activate crackseg && black archivo.py
conda activate crackseg && python -m ruff check archivo.py --fix
```

**Verification Test:**

```bash
echo "Environment verified" && which black && which basedpyright
```

---

**Remember**: This project aims to create a state-of-the-art crack segmentation
system. Every decision should advance this goal while maintaining code quality
and reproducibility.

**Rule System Version**: 1.2 - Refined with improved consistency and
troubleshooting

## AI Assistant Alert System

### 🚨 **Red Flag Trigger Words**

When AI Assistant encounters these scenarios, **STOP and verify rules**:

#### **Language Violation Triggers:**

- Writing Spanish in `.mdc`, `.py`, `.yaml`, `.md` files
- Mixing languages in technical documentation
- Using "REGLA", "Problema", "comando", "Patrón" in English docs

#### **Efficiency Violation Triggers:**

- Multiple `echo` commands in single terminal call
- `echo` followed by informational messages only
- Long terminal commands with no real work

#### **Quality Gate Violation Triggers:**

- Running `black`, `ruff`, `basedpyright` without `conda activate crackseg &&`
- Assuming tools are available without environment activation
- Skipping type checking or linting

#### **File Size Violation Triggers:**

- Creating files >300 lines without justification
- Modifying files >400 lines without refactoring plan
- Adding features to oversized files instead of refactoring
- Ignoring line count limits in implementation

#### **Uncertainty Violation Triggers:**

- Using "probably", "might work", "should resolve" without analysis
- Providing single uncertain solutions without alternatives
- Making recommendations without evidence
- Using vague language like "I think" or "maybe" without options

### 🔧 **Auto-Recovery Actions**

When red flags detected:

1. **Pause current action immediately**
2. **State the detected violation explicitly**
3. **Load relevant rules: `fetch_rules(["coding-standards"])`**
4. **Correct the approach before continuing**
5. **Confirm compliance before proceeding**

### 📋 **Best Practices for Rule Adherence**

- **Always load rules first** when starting any technical task
- **Read the checklist out loud** (mentally) before file changes
- **Default to English** for all project files unless explicitly conversation
- **Default to minimal terminal commands** - communicate in chat instead
- **When in doubt, ask the user** rather than assume
- **Always resolve problems at their root cause** rather than implementing workarounds
- **When uncertain, analyze 3+ options** rather than providing single uncertain solutions

**Principle:** Systematic verification prevents rule violations better than
post-error correction.
