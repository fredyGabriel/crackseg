# =============================================================================
# CrackSeg Project - Python Dependencies (PIP-ONLY)
# =============================================================================
# This file contains ONLY pip-specific dependencies that are NOT managed by conda.
# ALL core dependencies are managed via environment.yml
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# IMPORTANT: Always install conda environment first:
#   conda env create -f environment.yml
#   conda activate crackseg
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# NOTE: This file is now minimal! Almost everything is in environment.yml

# =============================================================================
# CURRENTLY EMPTY - ALL DEPENDENCIES MOVED TO CONDA!
# =============================================================================
# All major packages (PyTorch, Streamlit, Hydra, NumPy, OpenCV, etc.)
# are now installed via conda from environment.yml for better compatibility
# and dependency resolution.
#
# This file is kept for future pip-only packages that are not available
# in conda-forge.

# If you need to add pip-only dependencies, add them here with explanations
# Example:
# some-package-only-on-pypi>=1.0.0  # Not available in conda-forge
